# Toggle the floating nav bar on the AWS website and blog

## AWS
[The AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com) has a floating navigation bar on a lot of pages which, when viewing on a small screen takes up way too much screen real estate.

example: [Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/?nc2=h_rsc_lrn_tc)

example: [Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/building-an-ai-gateway-to-amazon-bedrock-with-amazon-api-gateway/)

## And...
...it is frustrating! It's too big and takes up too much screen, especially on smaller laptops and mobile/tablet devices when reading blog posts.

## Usage
The script will hide the nav bar by default.

To toggle the visibility of the floating nav bar use CTRL+h.

## Installation
